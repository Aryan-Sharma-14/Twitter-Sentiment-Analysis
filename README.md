# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

This project implements a **Twitter Sentiment Analysis model** that classifies tweets into **positive, negative, or neutral sentiments**. It leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques for text preprocessing and a **Machine Learning model** for sentiment prediction.

---

## Features
- Data preprocessing of tweets:
  - Cleaning text (removing URLs, mentions, hashtags, special characters, etc.)
  - Tokenization
  - Stopword removal
  - Stemming/Lemmatization
- Vectorization using **TF-IDF / Bag-of-Words**
- Model training using **Logistic Regression / Naïve Bayes / SVM** (depending on chosen approach)
- Evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Prediction of sentiment for new/unseen tweets

---

## Workflow

1. **Data Collection**
   - Tweets are loaded from a dataset (CSV/JSON) containing text and sentiment labels.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Clean the tweets by removing noise (links, mentions, emojis, numbers, punctuations).
   - Convert text to lowercase.
   - Tokenize words.
   - Remove stopwords.
   - Apply stemming or lemmatization.

3. **Feature Extraction**
   - Transform text into numerical representation using:
     - Bag of Words (BoW)
     - Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)

4. **Model Training**
   - Train ML classifiers such as:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Naïve Bayes
     - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   - Split dataset into **train/test** for evaluation.

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluate model with metrics:
     - Accuracy
     - Precision
     - Recall
     - F1-score
   - Generate confusion matrix for performance insights.

6. **Prediction**
   - Input new tweets and predict their sentiment in real-time.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/twitter-sentiment-analysis.git
   cd twitter-sentiment-analysis
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open Jupyter Notebook:
